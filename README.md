# Mongo-Scraper

This app will scrape each story from https://news.ycombinator.com/ using cheerio and save the title and link to a mongo database.

The user can click on one of these links on the site table to pull up a note takeing window and create a note tied to that link. This will save in the database and will be reloaded if the user clicks on the link again.
